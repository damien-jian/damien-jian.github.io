<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi there, this is Damien Jian (簡大閔 in Chinese, pronounced like Jian Da-Min). I'm a PhD student of <a href='https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/application/engapplied/Default.html'>Graduate Institute of Applied Physics</a> under the guidance of <a href='https://www.phys.ntu.edu.tw/enphysics/goan.html'>Prof. Hsi-Sheng Goan</a> at <a href='https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/'>National Taiwan University</a>.

I am interested in quantum machine learning, including but not limited to model design, training methods, and theoretical analysis. I am excited to work on discovering and exploring the quantum advantages of quantum computers in machine learning over classical machine learning.

I'm working on customizing these pages right now. It will soon looks better.
